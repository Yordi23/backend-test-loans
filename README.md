## How to use it?

Follow these steps:

1. Create your `.env` file, you can use the same values as in `.env.example` (only if your Mongo Database is running locally in the same port as specified there).
2. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start a Mongo database locally using docker (this is only necessary if you don't already have one running).
4. Run `npm start` to start the server.
